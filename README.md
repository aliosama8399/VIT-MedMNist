## Dataset

The Medical MNIST dataset consists of labeled images of blood cells, encompassing various cell types such as erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, etc. You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Model Architecture

The implemented Vision Transformer architecture follows the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The model utilizes self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies within the images, making it well-suited for image classification tasks.

For detailed information about the model architecture, please refer to the source code.
